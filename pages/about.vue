        <p>
          Hello, my name is Brett Butler and for 30 years I have been rescuing
          and rehabilitating dogs for placement with new families. The last 8
          years, corgis have been my sole focus. Corgis are such amazing, fun,
          smart, cute, energetic & challenging kids; they just won my heart. We
          corgi lovers know the addiction is real.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Over time my home has emerged as an unofficial corgi sanctuary and
          rehab, whereby corgi rescuers nationwide bring corgis to me. I am very
          grateful to have their trust, and the ability to provide this service.
          My pack and I have built a solid reputation as we focus on helping
          corgis heal their spirits, resolve behavior issues, and repair trust.
          Itâ€™s a team effort of rescuers, my personal 5 corgis, and the numbers
          of corgis who rotate in and out of my home. Consequently, I now have
          some corgis who will never leave due to issues. They function well in
          the structure of our pack, but we are unsure we can ever rehome them.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Corgwyn Rehab is a Sanctuary for the hard luck cases, the last resort
          cases, the bad behavior cases. We have taken in many that were
          scheduled to be Euthanized but were sent here instead and now function
          as a vital part of my pack. Our Goal is the help these corgwyn get to
          a balanced state of being so they can function as a part of the pack.
          If, in time working with a dog, we see that they have the ability to
          be rehomed then we will see to that also.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Our main function is not to rehome, it is to rehabilitate these
          special furkids. Some will be rehabilitated to that point but others
          will always be safe as a part of our pack. They are damaged too
          severely. I have learned that most of the damage is caused by forces
          outside of their control and with my help they can be turned around
          and function well in our pack.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This is an expensive endeavor. I am pursuing work to generate income
          for my base expenses; with additional funds needed to cover my corgi
          expenses. Last year my vet & med bills exceeded $8,000; and there was
          another $3,000 on food, toys & chew bones. I realize that in order for
          me to provide sanctuary for these corgis, I need investors help.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          My short term goal is to continue to operate successfully in my
          current space (fenced yard, no kids). My long term goal is to find a
          property even more suited for a larger more private sanctuary. As of
          9/2018 we are close to reaching this goal.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I have three primary areas of expense: Veterinary medicine, food and
          consumables, and supplies (to include the wear and tear on my home
          (carpet, doors, drywall, trim; which I can do the labor myself). My
          desire is to create sponsorships or donation streams that can fund
          these accounts (all overseen by others not just me). Until we get
          501c3 status, donors are welcome to donate directly to our vet, and
          trust that this is not in any way funding my personal life.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I am working with other experienced rescuers for advice and direction.
          My hope is that by assembling a core team of advisors and investors we
          can create a corgi sanctuary and serve the needs of corgis from our
          central location. I decided to take a risk and humbly ask for your
          support, because I know the incredible power of passionate people
          working in groups as I was part of the initial creation of the Corgi
          Coalition Transport Team. CCTT showed me that those of us with a will,
          find a way. And I know that if I reach out many great people will
          enable miracles to happen.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Our CRS administrators, at present, consists of myself, Brett Butler,
          and our secretary, LeAnne Foust. Due to my job, I may not be able to
          answer you as quickly as LeAnne can. Please know that we are in daily
          contact and she will always make sure I am informed. She is running
          our paperwork side of this endeavor and I am working with the corgwyn.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          If you choose to invest, I will work with my team to ensure updates so
          that you will know the difference you make. You can donate in small
          monthly amounts, single donation, or bi-annually; all directly to the
          funds or vets. As many of you know, running fundraisers is extremely
          time consuming & challenging. And sadly, my finances just do not allow
          me the luxury cushion I once had to easily provide for the corgis.
          Your participation will enable us to build a sustainable future to
          help corgis. Thank you seems too small a phrase to convey my
          gratitude; but know I most appreciably thank you!
